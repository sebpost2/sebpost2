# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm SebastiÃ¡n, a passionate developer and researcher from Peru. My interests span across **artificial intelligence**, **video game development**, **computer graphics**, and **cutting-edge programming technologies**. Iâ€™m currently exploring how AI can be leveraged within interactive experiencesâ€”such as estimating player emotions using psychological models to better understand player states and enhance gameplay experiences.

## About Me

- **Academic Background:**  
  I have a strong foundation in computer science, with a focus on AI, human-action recognition, and real-time interactions. My previous thesis work involved integrating **AlphaPose** and **TD-GCN** for enhanced human action recognition in contexts like surveillance and video games. While that research demonstrated the potential of combining pose estimation and temporal dynamics modeling, Iâ€™m now transitioning toward a more player-centric approachâ€”exploring how AI can interpret player emotions to adapt in-game experiences.

- **Programming Languages I Enjoy:**  
  - **C++**: For high-performance computing and graphics.
  - **Python**: For rapid prototyping in AI, machine learning, and data analysis.
  - **TypeScript / JavaScript**: For building scalable and maintainable front-end and back-end applications.
  
- **Interests:**  
  - **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
  - **Computer Graphics & Real-Time Rendering**  
  - **Game Development & Interactive Applications**  
  - **Data-Driven Gameplay Analytics**
